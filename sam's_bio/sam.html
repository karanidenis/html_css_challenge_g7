    <p>
        I'm deeply passionate about working with and supporting young people and giving them a jump-start in their careers.This stems from my own personal experience where I had minimal guidance in my career path. </p>
        Having gone through that experience of figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, I realized how that could slow anyone down.
      
        My name is Samuel Onyango Omondi, I am a software engineering student who loves solving problems using data.</span></p>
