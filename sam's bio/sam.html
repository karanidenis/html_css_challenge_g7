      I'm deeply passionate about working with and supporting young people and giving them a jump-start in their careers. This stems from my own personal experience where I had minimal guidance in my career path.I think it's incredibly important to have programs like these that take away all the barriers and constracts that prevent people from finding out what they need to be in an industry of their choosing and to be successful in any role they pursue.
